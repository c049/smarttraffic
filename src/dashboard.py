        Illegal parking and wrong-way driving are persistent challenges in urban areas, leading to congestion, safety risks, and inefficient road usage. Traditional enforcement relies heavily on manual monitoring, which is time-consuming and lacks scalability.

        This project introduces an AI-powered, real-time traffic violation detection system integrated with Digital Twin technology. By analyzing CCTV or street camera footage using deep learning algorithms (e.g., YOLOv8, OpenCV tracking), the system detects vehicles parked in restricted zones or moving against designated directions.

        Detection results are synchronized with a virtual Digital Twin‚Äîa dynamic 3D model that mirrors actual road conditions in real-time. This enables authorities to visually monitor violations, simulate traffic disruptions, and evaluate countermeasures.

        The system supports deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson, making it scalable across urban streets, schools, and intersections.

        Future development includes V2X communication, automated alerts, and educational feedback.

        st.markdown("""
        **‚Ä¢ Data Collection & Annotation**  
        Traffic footage from public datasets and simulated scenarios was used. Key frames were annotated with bounding boxes and motion directions to train detection models.

        **‚Ä¢ Model Architecture**  
        We utilize YOLOv8 for object detection, customized to recognize vehicle types and orientations. Optical flow and lane detection algorithms are integrated to identify wrong-way driving behavior.

        **‚Ä¢ Violation Detection Logic**  
        - *Illegal Parking*: Vehicles stationary in restricted zones beyond a set duration are flagged.  
        - *Wrong-Way Driving*: Vehicles moving against traffic flow or lane markings are detected and highlighted.

        **‚Ä¢ Digital Twin Integration**  
        Violations are mirrored in a 3D Digital Twin model of the city for intuitive visualization of locations and traffic disruptions.

        **‚Ä¢ Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**  
        A Streamlit dashboard presents camera feeds, alerts, and violation summaries.

        **‚Ä¢ Scalability & Deployment**  
        Designed for edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson), supporting urban-wide scalability.
